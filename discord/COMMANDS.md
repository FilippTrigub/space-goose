To view the full conversation history, you can use the K8s Manager API or web interface directly.

### Session Naming
- Sessions auto-created by `/ask` use timestamp format: `chat-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- Sessions created with `/sessions-create` can have custom names
- Session names must be unique within a project

### Streaming Behavior
- Responses are streamed in real-time
- Messages update every 3 seconds during streaming
